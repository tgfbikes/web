            Your first class is free!  So come see what we are all about.
            You can let us know you're coming by contacting us at info@crossfitoasis.com,
            but you don't have to; just come a few minutes prior to class time.
            After your first class, you will decide which plan is right for you and 
            schedule your two personal training sessions called "Foundations."  These
            sessions are normally $40 each.  The most popular option is our Start-Up
            Package which includes a month of CrossFit on the Unlimited Plan and Foundations
            for only $150.  Our memberships are month-to-month, there are no contracts or
            start-up fees, just the monthly membership price.  Four or more CrossFit
            classes per week is $120/month, and three or less CrossFit classes per week
            is $85/month.  This is the best investment in your health that you can make.
