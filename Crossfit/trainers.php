			<p class="trainerbio"><strong><em>CrossFit Level 1, CrossFit Weightlifting</em></strong>. High school was a very active time for me. I was one of the team Captains for my wrestling team, ran track, very engaged in snowboarding, hiking, scouting, and everything imaginable outdoors. Two weeks after graduating high school I was off to Marine Corps boot camp followed by infantry school. Since I was in the reserves however, exercise became a minimal thing for me until my military unit, Fox Company, 2/23 out of Fort Douglas, UT in Salt Lake was activated in 2002. A year later I took part in the invasion of Iraq with this Marine Corps Reserve unit which was quite a shock for most of us who had signed up for the college money! Once again, exercise was a thing of the past minus the occasional membership to a conventional gym where I would last for about a month or so doing three set of ten reps for various isolated movements at which time I would lose interest and stop going even though I was stuck in a yearlong contract. After my service in the Marine Corps I switch to the Army reserves for a career change. A few years ago, one of my best friends who I worked with on active duty started doing CrossFit. What in the world is CrossFit I asked? I decided to give it a try and was instantly hooked. Within a few months I was seeing dramatic results in my physical fitness tests. My training preparing for Army Special Forces was very rigorous but CrossFit was key to my physical success. In fact, I excelled and was one of the top guys on the training team physically.  I decided to couple my experience leading physical fitness in the military for about the last decade with my assignment teaching soldiers for the last three years and become a CrossFit trainer. I completed my CrossFit Level 1 Training at the Reebok headquarters in Canton, MA. Since then, I have completed the CrossFit Weightlifting Trainer Course. I can’t wait to make a difference in your life by helping bring your physical fitness level to where you are able to function better in any aspect of your life.

			<p class="trainerbio"><strong><em>CrossFit Level 1, CrossFit Level 2, University of Utah Personal Trainer Certificate</em></strong>. Growing up, I struggled with having a healthy weight. I didn’t “get” working out, but when I joined the military I needed to improve my physical abilities. I spent hour upon hour in the gym, doing some boring repetitive routine described in some fitness magazine- I spent the time because that’s what I thought it took to get in shape and be healthier, and that was what I wanted. But, I could never get the results I wanted. When I got out of the Army, I trained to be a teacher and worked in adult education for many years. A few years of living an unhealthy lifestyle took its toll on my health, until one day a friend suggested I try out CrossFit. Since starting CrossFit, I have changed my lifestyle completely and love every minute of it. Doing CrossFit has given me the physical ability to try out multiple sports, the mobility to do them without getting hurt, and the energy and confidence to get out of bed each morning and question myself- what am I going to do today that will keep me physically and mentally healthy, so that I can be present in my life. I want you to know that no matter what your lifestyle is, no matter what your background is, you can do this- come give CrossFit a try, it’s unlike any gym you’ve ever imagined.

			<p class="trainerbio"><strong><em>CrossFit Level 1</em></strong>. I have always been active in sports and the outdoors. It’s been a passion of mine since I can remember. I played soccer, basketball and softball throughout my school years and learned many lifelong lessons from the various coaches I’ve had. After graduating high school I decided that’s what I wanted to do. Coach and be able to give back some of what I had learned. So I received my bachelors degree in secondary education in physical education and health. I immediately got back into the high school sports scene and helped coach girls basketball for 4 years and softball for 1 year, which I LOVED,but it became too time consuming with 2 children and one on the way. In high school I was able to always stay active because I was in a sport year round. After graduating I had to create my own physical activity and exercise that I still needed daily. I would go to a regular  gym, completed the p90x and insanity programs or just went outside for a good run now and again. When I was pregnant with my third child, my sister had been introduced to CrossFit and told me it was something she thought I would love. Just over two years ago, I tried out and started CrossFit and have loved it ever since. I’m a true believer in CrossFit. The physical fitness you can achieve as well as the community/family feel cannot be beat. I can’t wait to share with you the things I’ve enjoyed and learned from CrossFit.

			<p class="trainerbio"><strong><em>CrossFit Level 1</em></strong>. I have been interested in strength / mechanics of our bodies since before I knew it; the first time I jumped my huffy of a curb and everything happened together in a way that made my little bike feel like an extension of my body, I felt like my body was a machine and thought to myself “that was badass”. I have been heavily involved in health and fitness for a number of years. When my second son was born and diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (a progressive terminal lung disease) I started to take health and fitness more seriously. I started crossfit in 2011 with my beautiful wife and haven’t stopped! Since then I have competed in several local throwdowns, competietive mountain bike races, placed first in the Utah Summer Games power lifting, ran spartans and I finished the SG marathon in 2013.

			<p class="trainerbio"><strong><em>CrossFit Level 1</em></strong>. I have always been active and on the go. I grew up in a very passionate baseball family. I hated it! I struck out and struggled to catch the ball. I was lucky that my family supported me in a sport that I was actually good at, gymnastics. My gymnastics backround has translated well in my love of crossfit. I’m a busy mom raising 2 extremely active boys.I started crossfit in 2011 and fell in love with the sport of fitness, it’s become a family affair! I love encouraging others to push harder and to get gymnasty.
