			<p class="trainerbio"><strong><em>CrossFit Level 1, CrossFit Level 2, University of Utah Personal Trainer Certificate</em></strong>. Since starting CrossFit, I have changed my lifestyle completely and love every minute of it. Doing CrossFit has given me the physical ability to try out multiple sports, the mobility to do them without getting hurt, and the energy and confidence to get out of bed each morning and question myself- what am I going to do today that will keep me physically and mentally healthy, so that I can be present in my life. I want you to know that no matter what your lifestyle is, no matter what your background is, you can do this- come give CrossFit a try, it’s unlike any gym you’ve ever imagined.

       Hello my name is Nicholas Leonhardt, but everyone calls me Nick. If there were four things to really describe who I am, and what I'm all about it would have to be Dogs, Skippy Peanut Butter, Good times, and The Art of Fitness. I love everything about fitness and what it does to change lives. I love giving back to those looking to better themselves in a more positive way through physical activity. I believe CrossFit has done great things for its members, and just its community overall. I'm happy to be apart of the CrossFit Oasis family, and am excited to get to know you.

              Kelly is a Yoga Teacher, Wife and a Mother of two. She has been certified at the 200-hr level since 2011 and has since completed an 85-hr Prenatal Certification as well a 50-hr Advanced Vinyasa training. Kelly has now taught over 500 hours of yoga studio classes including Vinyasa Flow, Prenatal and Children's Yoga. She has maintained a steady home practice and finds time for self-study on a regular basis to keep her classes knowledgeable, safe, fresh and fun. Always a student of yoga first, if you see her in a yoga class next to you, she will be trying to focus on her breath, find her balance and keep her intention in mind just as much as everyone else around her. Combining her love of yoga with family time means Kelly is striking a pose wherever they go and as her daughter says, "Mom, you do yoga everywhere!"
