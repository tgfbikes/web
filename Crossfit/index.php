         "I decided to couple my experience leading physical fitness in the military for about the last decade with my assignment teaching soldiers for the last three years and become a CrossFit trainer. I completed my CrossFit Level 1 Training at the Reebok headquarters in Canton, MA. Since then, I have completed the CrossFit Weightlifting Trainer Course. I canâ€™t wait to make a difference in your life by helping bring your physical fitness level to where you are able to function better in any aspect of your life."
