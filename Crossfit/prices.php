            into your fitness and health and will pay off in many more ways than just financially.
            <strong>We offer a 20% discount for military (active, guard, reserve), police, and firefighters</strong>
            on Foundations and unlimited memberships because we want to give back to those who are there to
            safeguard the rest of us- we know that the better prepared you are physically, the better
            job you will be able to do to help protect the rest of us. Thank you for your service.
