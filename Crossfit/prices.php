        <p>
        	CrossFit should be attainable for anyone, so we offer the lowest rates we can to 
            everyone and do not discounts for different jobs or lifestyles. CrossFit is an investment 
            into your fitness and health and will pay off in many more ways than just financially. 
            <strong>We offer a 15% discount for military (active, guard, reserve), police, and firefighters</strong> 
            on Foundations and unlimited memberships because we want to give back to those who are there to 
            safeguard the rest of us- we know that the better prepared you are physically, the better 
            job you will be able to do to help protect the rest of us. Thank you for your service.
