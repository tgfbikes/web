MVC = Model, View, Controller


Seperate code into more manageable parts

Controller
===============
Send and receive data

View
===============
What's sent to the web browser

Model
==============
Manipulates/stroes data
	- changing
	- CRUD data from the database
		=> Create, Read, Update, Delete
	- sending emails/texts
