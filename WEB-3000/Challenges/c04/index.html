            <h3>Because giving others what you don't want is fun...</h3>
            <p>The :not CSS selector will apply to everything else NOT what you have specified.</p>
            <h4>For example</h4>
            <blockquote>
                :not(blockquote) {<br>
                <span class="tabbed">font-family: Avenir, sans-serif;</span><br>
                <span class="tabbed">color: #000;</span><br>
                }<br>
                <p>
                    So as you can see, everything else besides the blockquote is Avenir (blockquote is set to Helvetica)
                    or sans-serif; based off the browser.
                </p>

                Now lets get fancy, and not just regular fancy, but Canadian fancy.  You can also designate a
                selector, for our purposes an li with a class, to be singled out of the styling from the rest.
            </p>
            <h4>Exhibit A...eh</h4>
            <blockquote>
                li:not(.somethingelse) {<br>
                <span class="tabbed">color: red;</span><br>
                )<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give me what you don't want</li>
                    <li class="somethingelse">I don't want this color, I'm going to dump it on all these other chumps</li>
                    <li>I'll take some also jerk face li tag</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                   Here we are making every other li font color red except the li with the class
                    somehtingelse.  If that doesn't scream maple leaf magic I don't know what does.
                </p>
