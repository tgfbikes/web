        <h1>Vegetarians Love Meat</h1>
        <h4>Because denial is fun...</h4>
        <p>Vegetarians love meat more than a T-Rex who gave up bacon for Lent.  Most of the time
        Vegetarians (or for the remainder of this deprecated XHTML example, shall be referred to as Communists)
        call meat in the middle of the night and, upon meat answering the phone, hang up promptly
        for the fear of becoming American.</p>
